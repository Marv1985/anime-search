# Anime Search game

This is my first React project that I made. Anime search is a Where's Wally game alternative where you have to find the characters in the picture. It has some backend capabilities in that you can add you name and time to the leaderboard after each game is completed. It was created using React, Firebase and some Jest TDD. I wish I made it more responsive but still happy with what I learned.
